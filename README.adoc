= Background

In order to confirm that there is not some nasty artefact inside of chronicle queue causing the nasty
high percentile latencies we sometimes see, this is a test of chronicle queue against the simplest possible
comparison I could find - Agrona's ringbuffer.

Chronicle queue does a lot more than Agrona ringbuffer e.g. indexing, rolling, unbounded etc.

There is a JLBH test for queue and another for Agrona and each test starts up a consumer thread to read messages,
and generates them in the JLBH thread. The Agrona test uses a memory-mapped file to make it as similar
as possible to CQ. We measure the time it takes to get from producer thread to consumer thread.

= Results

Agrona vs Queue

* very similar at 99.99/worst 
* Agrona consistently better at lower percentiles which of course is to be expected as it is doing less

The fact that they are pretty much the same at worst says to me that we don't have any lurking issues
in chronicle queue. Blame the OS!
